/**
    Main file for the Locked Archive project -- MEDIUM instance.

    Follows the same load pattern as the course's own main_01.pl
    (elevator example): it loads the "plain" IndiGolog interpreter
    (no environment manager / external devices needed, since this
    domain is purely simulated) and then the application files.

    This file must be placed so that config.pl (defining dir/2 and
    interpreter/1) is loaded FIRST. On the course VM this typically
    means either:
      (a) copying/symlinking this whole indigolog/ folder into
          <indigolog-main>/examples/locked_archive/, then running:
              swipl <indigolog-main>/config.pl main_easy.pl
      (b) or, if config.pl auto-loads relative to itself, running
          swipl from inside <indigolog-main>/examples/locked_archive/
              swipl ../../config.pl main_easy.pl
    Check config.pl's own header comments on the VM for the exact
    invocation it expects (see main.pl / main_01.pl in the course
    examples for the exact convention used there).

% Usage (from a fresh swipl session, AFTER config.pl + this file loaded):
%
%   ?- initialize.      % MANDATORY before first run (NOT initialize(evaluator))
%   ?- main.                    % interactive controller picker
%   ?- main(simple).            % or directly: control_simple
%   ?- main(reactive).          % or directly: control_reactive
%
% Reasoning tasks (course-standard, once initialize has run):
%
%   Legality -- indigolog/1 takes the action sequence in NATURAL order
%   (first action executed first), exactly as you'd write it (this is
%   the minimal 14-action plan through the mandatory combine puzzle):
%     ?- indigolog([pick_up(key_a,r1), read_clue(l2,r1), unlock_with_key(l1,key_a), unlock_with_code(l2), move(r1,r2,l1), pick_up(item_x,r2), move(r2,r3,l2), pick_up(item_y,r3), combine(item_x,item_y,key_c), unlock_with_key(l3,key_c), move(r3,r4,l3), read_clue(l4,r4), unlock_with_code(l4), move(r4,r5,l4)]).
%
%   Projection -- eval/3 takes the action sequence in REVERSED order
%   (most recently executed action FIRST -- mirrors do(a,s) nesting).
%   This is the opposite convention from indigolog/1 above -- the SAME
%   14-action plan as above, reversed, checking at(r5) holds at the end:
%     ?- holds(at(r5), [move(r4,r5,l4), unlock_with_code(l4), read_clue(l4,r4), move(r3,r4,l3), unlock_with_key(l3,key_c), combine(item_x,item_y,key_c), pick_up(item_y,r3), move(r2,r3,l2), pick_up(item_x,r2), move(r1,r2,l1), unlock_with_code(l2), unlock_with_key(l1,key_a), read_clue(l2,r1), pick_up(key_a,r1)]).
